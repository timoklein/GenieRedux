🚧🚧🚧 We are currently rolling out our codebase for <b>"Exploration-Driven Generative Interactive Environments"</b>!

We present a framework for training multi-environment world models spanning hundreds of environments with different visuals and actions. Our training is cost-effective, as we make use of automatic collection from virtual environments instead of hand-curated datasets of human demonstrations. It consists of 3 components:

* <b>RetroAct</b> - a dataset of 974 annotated retro game environments - behavior, camera view, motion axis and controls
* <b> GenieRedux-G </b> - a multi-environment transformer world model, adapted for virtual environments and an enhanced version of GenieRedux - our open version of the Genie world model (Bruce et. al.).
* <b> AutoExplore Agent</b> - an exploration agent that explores environments entirely based on the dynamics prediction uncertainty of GenieRedux, escaping the need for an environment-specific reward and providing diverse training data for our world model.

Our original GenieRedux and GenieRedux-G implementations on the CoinRun test case study, as provided in our [NeurIPS'24 D3S3 paper](https://nsavov.github.io/GenieRedux/) - , are provided on the [neurips](https://github.com/insait-institute/GenieRedux/tree/neurips) branch.

In our latest work, we demonstrate our method on many platformer environments, obtained from our annotated dataset. We provide the training and evaluation code.

## Installation
<b>Prerequisites:</b>
- Ensure you have Conda installed on your system. You can download and install Conda from the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

1. <b>Clone the repository.</b>
   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/insait-institute/GenieRedux.git
    cd GenieRedux
   ```

2. <b> Data Generation Environment Installation. </b>
  This will install the `retro_datagen` environment which enables the use of the Stable Retro environments:
   ```shell
    conda env create -f data_generation/retro_env.yml
    conda activate retro_datagen
   ```

   Import the game ROMs following the [Stable Retro instructions](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro?tab=readme-ov-file#documentation)

3. <b>GenieRedux Environment  Installation.</b>
  Set up the Python environment:
   ```shell
    conda env create -f genie_redux_env.yaml
    conda activate genie_redux
   ``` 
   This script will create a conda environment named `genie_redux`.

   Note: This implementation is tested on Linux-64 with Python 3.10 and Conda package manager.

## Quickstart

### Data Generation

Initial setup:
```
cd data_generation
conda activate retro_datagen
```

To generate all datasets (saved in `data_generation/datasets/`), run:

```bash
python generate.py
python generate.py --config configs/data_gen_retro_control.json
python generate.py --config configs/data_gen_retro_control_test_set.json
```

### Training GenieRedux

Before we start, we set up the environment:
```bash
conda activate genie_redux
```

We trained GenieRedux and GenieRedux-G on 7 A100 GPUs, with batch size 84. We provide the settings as we used them in the following instructions, the parameters can be changed according to GPU and memory limitations.

#### Tokenizer
To train the tokenizer for on the generated dataset (for 150k iterations), run:
```bash
bash run.sh --config=tokenizer.yaml --num_processes=6 --train.batch_size=7 --train.grad_accum=2
```

#### GenieRedux (Dynamics+LAM)
Using the tokenizer that we just train, we can now train GenieRedux:
```bash
bash run.sh --config=genie_redux.yaml --num_processes=7 --train.batch_size=3 --train.grad_accum=4
```

#### GenieRedux-G (Dynamics Only)
Alternatively, to use the ground truth actions instead of LAM:
```bash
bash run.sh --config=genie_redux_guided.yaml --num_processes=7 --train.batch_size=4 --train.grad_accum=3
```

### Evaluation of GenieRedux

To get quantitative evaluation (ΔPSNR, FID, PSNR, SSIM):
```bash
bash run.sh --config=genie_redux.yaml --mode=eval --eval.action_to_take=-1 --eval.model_fpath=<path_to_model> --eval.inference_method=one_go
```

## Data Generation

Initial setup:
```bash
cd data_generation
conda activate coinrun
```

Data generation is ran in the following format:
```
python generate --config configs/<CONFIG_NAME>.json
```

### Data Generation With A Trained Agent

In Quickstart, we saw how to generate data with a random agent. Here we discuss using a PPO agent.

For training a PPO agent, follow the instructions in the [Coinrun repository](https://github.com/openai/coinrun).
It is expected that the pretrained model weights are at `data_generation/external/coinrun/coinrun/saved_models/sav_myrun_0`.

Run generation with:
```bash
python generate.py --config configs/data_gen_ppo.json
```

For a test set:

```bash
python generate.py --config /external/data_gen_ppo_test_set.json
```
### Data Generation Parameters

Additional customization is available in the configuration files in `data_generation/configs/`. Note the following important properties:
- `image_size` - defines the resolution of the images (default: 64)
- `n_instances` - number of episodes to generate
- `n_steps_max` - maximum number of steps before ending the episode
- `n_workers` - number of workers to generate episodes in parallel

## Training
### Training Configuration


This project leverages **Hydra** for flexible configuration management:

- Custom configurations should be added to the `configs/config/` directory.
- Modify `default.yaml` to set new defaults.
- Create new configuration files, with the predifined confifg `yaml` files as their base.

Control is given over model and training parameters, as well as dataset paths. 
For example, dataset arguments are provided in the following format:

```yaml
train:
  dataset_root_dpath: <path_to_dataset_root_directory>
  dataset_name: <dataset_name>
```

And if you want to train the `GenieRedux` or `GenieReduxGuided` model, an already trained tokenizer must be provided:

```yaml
tokenizer_fpath: <path_to_tokenizer>
```

### Running Training

`run.sh` is a wrapper script that we use for all our training and evaluation tasks. It streamlines specifying configurations and overriding parameters.

```bash
bash run.sh --config=<CONFIG_NAME>.yaml
```

Current available configurations are:   

- `tokenizer.yaml` (Default)
- `genie_redux.yaml`
- `genie_redux_guided.yaml`



### CLI Training Customization

You can override parameters directly from the command line. For example, to specify training steps:

```bash
bash run.sh --train.num_train_steps=10000
```

This overrides the `num_train_steps` parameter defined in `configs/config/default.yaml`.

Another example, where we train on 2 GPUs with batch size 2, using a specified tokenizer and dataset:

```bash

./run --num_processes=2 --config=genie_redux.yaml --tokenizer_fpath=<path_to_tokenizer> --train.dataset_root_dpath=<path_to_dataset_root_directory> --train.dataset_name=<dataset_name> --train.batch_size=2
```

We note two important parameters:

- `model`: This is the model you want to train. The training and evaluation scripts use this argument to determine which model to instantiate. The available options are:
  - `tokenizer`
  - `genie_redux`
  - `genie_redux_guided`

- `mode`: This determines if we want to train or evaluate a model:
  - `train`
  - `eval`


## Evaluation

With a single script, we provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation. We support two types of evaluation, specified by `eval.action_to_take` argument.

`model_path` parameter should be set to the path of the model you want to evaluate.

### Replication Evaluation

In this evaluation the model attempts to replicate a sequence of observations, given a single observation and a sequence of actions. Qualitative results are stored in `eval.save_root_dpath`. Quantitative results from the comparison with the ground truth are shown at the end of execution.

To enable this evaluation, set `eval.action_to_take=-1`.

### Control Evaluation

This evaluation is meant for qualitative results only. An action of choice, designated by an index (0 to 7 in the case of Coinrun), is given and it is executed by the model for the full sequence, given an input image.

To enable this evaluaiton, set `eval.action_to_take=<ACTION_ID>`, where `<ACTION_ID>` is the aciton index.


### Evaluation Modes

There are two evaluation modes:

- `one_go`: This mode evaluates the model by a one-go inference, using the ground truth actions or the specified action. This mode is faster than the autoregressive mode, and is suitable for testing the model's performance and debugging.

- `autoregressive`: This mode evaluates the model by an autoregressive inference, using the ground truth actions or the specified action. This mode is for better visual quality and controllability, but is computationally expensive.

### Example

```bash
./run.sh --config=genie_redux.yaml --mode=eval --eval.action_to_take=1 --eval.model_path=<path_to_model> --eval.inference_method=one_go
```

The above command will evaluate the model at the specified path using the action at index `1`, which corresponds to the `RIGHT` action in the `CoinRun` dataset. You can see the visualizations of the model's predictions in the `./outputs/evaluation/<model-name>/<dataset>/`, dirctory, which is default path for the evaluation results.
